A collection of programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Running the Code

### 1. Using the Terminal:
To compile and run the Java code from the terminal, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Java file**:
   ```bash
   javac Filename.java
   ```
   Replace `Filename.java` with the name of your Java source file.

2. **Run the compiled Java program**:
   ```bash
   java Filename
   ```
   Ensure that you do not include the `.java` extension while running the program.

### 2. Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
To run the Java program in **VS Code**:

1. Open the Java file in the editor.
2. Save the file.
3. Click on **Run** or use the `Run Java Code` command available in the editor to compile and execute the program automatically.
